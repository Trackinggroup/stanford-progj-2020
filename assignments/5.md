- [Register for a ProPublica API Key](#propublica-api-key)

## Python reading and practice

Read up on and practice the below techniques:

* Read up on [sorting](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) through [Ascending and Descending](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#ascending-and-descending)
* Refresh on [Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
* Read [Portable paths](../docs/python/portable_paths.md) and try creating some dummy directories and files that resemble those described in the examples in order to practice the techniques. For the environment variable section, you can simply use one of the  [Datakit](../docs/datakit.md) projects we created for an earlier assignment. These projects contain a `scripts/1-etl.py` script that demonstrates the environment variable approach.

## ProPublica API Key

Sign up for a [ProPublica API Key](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api). In the web registration form, state that you plan to use the API for "data journalism course work at Stanford University". **Make sure you stash away the key and do not lose it!** You'll need the key for the next assignment!
